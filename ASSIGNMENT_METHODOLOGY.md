## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategies Explained

### **1. Zero-Shot Strategy**
```python
def generate_prompt(self, problem):
    return {
        "system": "You are an expert mathematics tutor...",
        "user": f"Solve this math problem step by step: {problem}"
    }
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Direct Approach**: No examples needed, relies on model's pre-trained knowledge
- **Efficiency**: Fastest response time, minimal prompt length
- **Use Case**: Simple, straightforward problems with clear solution paths

**Effectiveness Factors:**
- Model's mathematical training quality
- Problem complexity and ambiguity level
- Clear instruction formatting

### **2. Few-Shot Strategy**
```python
def generate_prompt(self, problem):
    examples = """
    Example 1: Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 16
    Solution: x = 3
    
    Example 2: Find area of rectangle: length=6, width=4
    Solution: Area = 24 cm²
    """
    return {"user": f"{examples}\nNow solve: {problem}"}
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Pattern Learning**: Model learns solution format from examples
- **Consistency**: Examples establish expected response structure
- **Context Setting**: Demonstrates domain-specific notation and approach

**Effectiveness Factors:**
- Quality and relevance of chosen examples
- Similarity between examples and target problem
- Example diversity covering edge cases

### **3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Strategy**
```python
def generate_prompt(self, problem):
    return {
        "user": f"""
        Let's solve this step by step:
        1. First, identify the problem type
        2. Determine the applicable formula
        3. Work through the solution systematically
        4. Verify the answer makes sense
        
        Problem: {problem}
        """
    }
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Explicit Reasoning**: Forces model to show logical progression

    return {
        "user": f"""
        Before solving, let me ask myself:
        - What exactly is this problem asking?
        - What information do I have?
        - What formula/concept should I use?
        - What would be a reasonable answer range?
        
        Problem: {problem}
        """
    }
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Metacognitive Approach**: Model reflects on problem before solving
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Self-questioning clarifies unclear aspects

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology & Scoring Systems

### **1. Accuracy Score (0-1 Scale)**

#### **Implementation:**
```python
def score_accuracy(self, expected, actual):
    # Normalize both answers for comparison
    expected_clean = re.sub(r'[^\w\d./=\s]', '', str(expected).lower())
    actual_clean = re.sub(r'[^\w\d./=\s]', '', str(actual).lower())
    
    # Check for exact match or key components
    if expected_clean in actual_clean or actual_clean in expected_clean:
        return 1.0
    
    # Numerical equality check
    expected_nums = re.findall(r'[0-9.]+', expected_clean)
    actual_nums = re.findall(r'[0-9.]+', actual_clean)
    
    if expected_nums and actual_nums:
        if expected_nums[0] == actual_nums[0]:
            return 1.0
    
    return 0.0
```

#### **Why This Approach:**
- **Flexibility**: Handles different answer formats (x=5, x = 5, "x equals 5")
- **Robustness**: Ignores formatting differences while preserving meaning
- **Binary Scoring**: Clear pass/fail for mathematical correctness

#### **Scoring Criteria:**
- **1.0**: Mathematically correct final answer
- **0.0**: Incorrect or missing final answer

### **2. Reasoning Clarity Score (1-5 Scale)**

```python
def score_reasoning_clarity(self, response_text):
    score = 1  # Base score
    
    # Step-by-step structure (+1)
    if re.search(r'step\s*\d+|first|second|third|next|then|finally', 
                 response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
        score += 1
    
    # Mathematical explanations (+1)
    if re.search(r'because|since|therefore|thus|so|reason|explanation', 
                 response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
        score += 1
    
    # Formula mentions (+1)
    if re.search(r'formula|equation|method|approach|technique', 
                 response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
        score += 1
    
    # Clear organization (+1)
    lines = response_text.strip().split('\n')
    if len(lines) >= 3:
        score += 1
    
    return min(score, 5)
```

#### **Why This Approach:**
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Evaluates different aspects of explanation quality

### **3. Hallucination Score (0-3 Scale)**

#### **Implementation:**
```python
def score_hallucination(self, response_text, problem_context):
    hallucination_score = 0
    
    # Mathematical fact errors (+1 each)
    incorrect_facts = [
        r'π\s*=\s*[^2][^2]',          # π ≠ 22/7 or 3.14...
        r'sin\s*30°?\s*=\s*(?!0\.5|1/2)',  # sin 30° should be 0.5
        r'cos\s*90°?\s*=\s*(?!0)',         # cos 90° should be 0
    ]
    
    for pattern in incorrect_facts:
        if re.search(pattern, response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
            hallucination_score += 1
    
    # Impossible operations (+1)
    if re.search(r'divide\s+by\s+zero|infinity\s*=|negative\s+square\s+root', 
                 response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
        hallucination_score += 1
    
    # Contradictory statements (+1)
    if re.search(r'always\s+never|never\s+always|impossible\s+possible', 
                 response_text, re.IGNORECASE):
        hallucination_score += 1
    
    return min(hallucination_score, 3)
```

#### **Why This Approach:**
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Focuses on domain-specific correctness
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses regex to identify common mathematical errors
- **Safety Critical**: Math education requires factual accuracy

#### **Scoring Criteria:**
- **0**: No mathematical errors or false statements
- **1**: Minor factual error or questionable statement
- **2**: Multiple errors or significant mathematical mistake
- **3**: Severe errors that could mislead students

### **4. Consistency Score (0-1 Scale)**

#### **Implementation:**
```python
def test_consistency(self, problem, strategy, num_runs=3):
    responses = []
    for i in range(num_runs):
        result = self.test_single_problem(problem, strategy)
        if "error" not in result:
            responses.append(result["extracted_answer"])
    
    if len(responses) < 2:
        return 0.0
    
    # Check if all responses are the same
    unique_responses = set(responses)
    consistency_score = 1.0 - (len(unique_responses) - 1) / len(responses)
    return consistency_score
```

#### **Why This Approach:**
- **Reliability Measurement**: Tests if model gives same answer repeatedly
- **Temperature Independence**: Measures stability across runs
- **User Trust**: Consistent responses build confidence in the system

#### **Scoring Criteria:**
- **1.0**: Identical answers across all runs
- **0.67**: 2 out of 3 runs give same answer
- **0.33**: All different answers
- **0.0**: Unable to complete multiple runs

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Fallback Mechanism**
```python
def is_ambiguous(self, user_input):
    ambiguous_keywords = ["help", "teach", "explain", "what is", "how to"]
    math_indicators = ["=", "+", "-", "solve", "find", "calculate", "area"]
    
    words = user_input.lower().split()
    if len(words) <= 3:
        return any(keyword in user_input.lower() for keyword in ambiguous_keywords)
    
    has_math_content = any(indicator in user_input.lower() for indicator in math_indicators)
    return not has_math_content
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **Proactive Error Prevention**: Catches unclear inputs before processing

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": prompt_dict["system"]},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt_dict["user"]}
    ]
    
    payload = {
        "model": "meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        "messages": messages,
        "max_tokens": max_tokens,
        "temperature": 0.1,  # Low temperature for consistency
        "stream": False
    }
```

**Configuration Rationale:**
